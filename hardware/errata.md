v1 errata
=========
- Use larger pads for through-hole components
    - Don't use NPTH for potentiometer mounting holes
- Connect EN to VIN on MIC5504
    - Consider replacing with NCP114
- DFU boot button doesn't seem to work
    - Should be connected to VCC not GND, doesn't need R
- Flip the pot on the board, so 0V is at the left
- Tempo down button is hard to press
- "Downstream"/"Upstream" are bad names and/or wrong
